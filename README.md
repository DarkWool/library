# Library Project, [view live](https://darkwool.github.io/library/)

This was a project made for The Odin Project curriculum, further specifications can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library)

The main task was to give the user an opportunity to add new books with a form via JavaScript and link the DOM elements generated with an array, all of this using object constructors and I can say that this was a perfect opportunity to learn tons of new things!

## Main requirements:
- A button to toggle the read status of a book.
- A Button to delete a book from the page.
- A form to let the user create a new book.
- A function that updates the books on the page.
- To link the DOM elements with an array.

## Things I learned:
1. How to work with objects and learned more about the 'this' keyword.
2. Why and how to work with constructors.
3. Better ways to manipulate the DOM.
4. To link an array with a DOM element.
5. How to make a modal and its functionality.
6. To understand how to work with CSS variables in better ways.
7. To build a dark mode theme using JavaScript and CSS.
8. This was my first time using CSS pseudo-elements and I truly loved them!
9. To use more complex CSS selectors.
10. How to make a progress bar, style it and make it work with JavaScript.
